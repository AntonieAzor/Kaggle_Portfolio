🚲 London Cycle Hire — Data Analysis Mini-Project with SQL
📊 Project Overview

This mini-project explores data from the London Cycle Hire scheme to practise querying, aggregating, and interpreting a real-world public dataset.

The aim of the project is not to produce advanced modelling, but to demonstrate a clear, structured approach to:

working with a large dataset

writing clean SQL queries

answering practical questions using data

🧠 What I Was Trying to Learn

This project was completed as part of my ongoing data analytics training, with a focus on strengthening my understanding of:

Filtering data using WHERE

Grouping data using GROUP BY

Applying aggregate functions such as COUNT, AVG, and SUM

Ordering and limiting results

Thinking critically about what the results actually mean

🛠 Tools & Technologies

SQL (BigQuery)

Kaggle Notebooks

Public open data (London Cycle Hire dataset)

GitHub (project documentation)

🔍 Key Questions Explored

Some of the questions explored in this project include:

How does ride duration vary by year?

What patterns can be seen when grouping rides over time?

How can aggregation help summarise large volumes of data meaningfully?

What limitations should be considered when interpreting the results?

📈 Approach

Explored the structure of the dataset and relevant columns

Filtered data to focus on specific time periods

Grouped data to identify trends and averages

Interpreted results carefully, noting assumptions and limitations

The emphasis throughout was on clarity and correctness, rather than complexity.

📌 Notes

This project is intentionally scoped as a mini-project.
It reflects where I am in my learning journey and focuses on building strong fundamentals that I can carry forward into more complex analyses.

🌱 What I’d Improve Next

Deeper time-based analysis (monthly / seasonal patterns)

More complex joins with related datasets

Clearer visual summaries of results

Thanks for taking the time to look through this project.
